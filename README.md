# Build Process
This application was build using rollup, typescript, and postcss. Rollup was used due to its speed and simplicity over webpack, average build times are 3-4 seconds. Typescript was used to provide typesafety, and scalibility. Postcss was used to allow for better polyfilling and combatibility across browsers.
